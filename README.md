This is atempt to clone Asteroids game using DOTS

Currently what it have is:

- Spaceship movement
- Spaceship shooting
- Random Asteroids
- Hypertravel movement 
- UFO that shoots to the player
- Shield Power Up

The next step I'm working on is creating a new power up to change the spaceship fire rate.

I tried to reuse the most of the components as I could like
 - Movement
 - Destroyable

Also there are a bunch of descrution system that I will try to abstract inside a single structure after finish the next power up
